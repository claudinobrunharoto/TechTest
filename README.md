# MARKDOWN test
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7m1i0r6IOQ
#### Description: The project converts the text typed in the edit into a QRCode using ImageCharts API. (https://documentation.image-charts.com)

##Colaborator: Pedro Taiette Sato Librais
We decided to do this project thanks to a difficulty that one of Pedro's teachers had in passing on a link to her students. She used to write the link on the board and ask students to copy it, which led to a lot of mistakes. PS: we have already received praise from her and other teachers who have started using this application in the classroom. ;)

Files:
FinalProject.dpr -> this file contains the routines to start the project (Initialize, CreateForm, and Run methods).
FinalProject.dproj -> it has all project settings in a XML format.
####FinalProject.exe -> a Windows executable (32 bits version). It is the result of the project.
FinalProject.res -> an application's resource file. It stores some configuration, dependencies, security data, etc...
Main.fmx -> it contains all the visual aspects of the main form.
Main.pas -> it is the logic code of the main form writen in Object-Pascal.
OptionsForm.fmx -> it contains all the visual aspects of the option form.
OptionsForm.pas -> it is the logic code of the option form.

#### FMX files are like the Front-End part of Delphi projects while PAS files are the Back-End code.
